'''OPERATOR ASSIGNMENT'''

# Python divides the operators in the following groups:

# Arithmetic operators
# Assignment operators
# Comparison operators
# Logical operators
# Identity operators
# Membership operators
# Bitwise operators

# +	Addition	x + y
a = 4
e = 4
print(a + e)	
# -	Subtraction		
e = 4
t = 4
print(e - t)
# *	Multiplication		
w = 3
r = 5
print(w * r)

# /	Division	
d = 5
t = 2
print(d / t)

# %	Modulus	
d = 5
e = 2
print(d % e)	
# **	Exponentiation	
f = 5
t = 9
print(f ** t)
# //	Floor division	x // y	
f = 6
r = 5
print(f // r)
